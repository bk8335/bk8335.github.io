As I'm feeling motivated for the year (and decade) ahead this feels like a good time to list some goals out for 2020.

1. No meat, no booze, and no sweet things in January.

1. Run from Edinburgh to Falkirk [(~51km)](https://gb.mapometer.com/running/route_4990918.html).

1. Write one blog post a week.

1. Keep working on [holfolio.com](//holfolio.com). A place to share and track your investment portfolio.

1. Own my first property

At the end of 2020 I can evaluate how many of these were achieved, and how I did on each.
