This is a website called holfolioben.com but I have not explained why that is or what it means. 
Its not a complicated answer but is worth keeping a record of it if I am ever asked that question in the future.

Short answer: My name is Ben, and the sideproject I'm working on is called Holfolio.

Longer answer: My name is Benjamin :)  
One of [my 2020 goals](https://holfolioben.com/misc/2019/12/31/why-hello-there.html) is to keep working on [holfolio.com](//holfolio.com). This is a sideproject I've been ruminating on for a while.
I want to make it easy to share your investment portfolio with others, and see what others are doing with their money, not just listen to your friend boast about buying shares of Apple 10 years ago (when they either didn't, or they sold it a few months later and though they had "beaten the market" with a 10% gain, rather than the 1000%+ if they'd held on for longer).
Lots of us know what we should do with our money (at least at the basic level, i.e. not spend so much of it, save more of it), yet very few of us do what we 'should'. But if we see what others are actually doing with their own money it might be the nudge to improving our own habits. I feel like allowing us to peek in and see how others actually invest will help bring down one of the (many) barriers of investing. 
As a general rule, the more people who are investing, the better. There are millions of people who should be getting a return of 7% a year on their money, not the 0.01% in their bank account.

So that is the aim of Holfolio - reducing barriers to investing by seeing how others invest (showing what they do, rather than telling you what you should do)
