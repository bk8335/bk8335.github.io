I predict/expect that online identify fragmentation will continue in the 2020s. I believe this has already started for a couple of years, but will really pick up steam again this decade. And [this tweet](https://twitter.com/andymci/status/1213136626760728577) backed me up/provided confirmation bias for the idea :)	

As the famous quote says, [_in business, there are two ways to make money. You can bundle, or you can unbundle._](https://hbr.org/2014/07/marc-andreessen-and-jim-barksdale-on-how-to-make-money)

And as two companies with a combined market cap of over $1.5 trillion, Google and Facebook have shown the value in bundling together our online selves (for billions of people to be shown thousands of adverts every year).
But as with many things, these go in cycles, and I believe the next cycle is showing signs of starting. Trust in Facebook and Google is falling. e.g. Facebook Portal (where most reviews said the product was good, just that it is from the evil empire) [didn't crack the top 200 chart for apps on Christmas morning](https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1209916611072647169). I believe that Facebook's relevance has peaked, especially the main blue feed. While instagram and whatsapp are still valuable and growing, it is hard to see whether they can fully replace the withering blue feed as quickly. 

To put it neatly, the noughties on the internet were about joining lots of different communities and discovering many different ways to interact with each other. Then the 2010s saw the consolidation of Facebook and Google trying to control everything (why should my youtube profile picture be the same as my email one? Other than they are both controlled by the same company of course).
And I believe we are starting to see it slowly break up again.

In real life we have many different personas; we are different people at work than we are with our family than we are with our friends than we are at the gym. And as the internet becomes a larger and larger part of our lives, we shouldn't expect to have a single online identity either. A clear success story would be our professional personas and how LinkedIn has carved that out from FB/Google (although it is a topic for another day how much bullshit is posted on there everyday). And yet we see that fragment again - the person I am on [indiehackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/ben_k) is very different to the person I pretend to be on LinkedIn. So I don't just have a single professional persona, but I have a 9-5 professional persona, and a '5-9' professional persona. And we see new social networks allowing this to continue, e.g. exercise on Strava or Zwift, dieting on MyFitnessPal, tons of niche communities on Reddit. We don't want to give everyone the same version of ourselves.

And that is one reason why I believe so much in the idea of [Holfolio](https://www.holfolio.com/), my project to track and share your investment portfolios with one another. There is space to share investments you hold (not precise amounts, but in percentages of the total), track how they are doing, and see how other people invest their money as well. You probably don't want google to know exactly which stocks you own (even if they can deduce it), but using a pseudonymous username can free us from the social taboo of discussing money and explicitly requires a new online identity. I believe in the power of showing rather than telling with investments (as telling is clearly not working), and this will help demystify the finance industy by working together and get more people invested in the stock market.

So hopefully once world war 3 and the zombie outbreak has abated, we can look forward to wrestling back control of our online identities from Facebook and Google, and be more of a particular version of ourselves in different spaces online, just as we do in the real world.
