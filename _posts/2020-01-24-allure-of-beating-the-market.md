Look at the chart of Tesla stock in the last 18 months - it does not exactly scream efficient does it?!

From the $420 "funding secured" debacle in summer 2018, it fell to <$180 in May 2019 but has now (albeit briefly) gone above $540!In 2018 I had long felt Tesla was overpriced and wanted to short it after "funding secured". And in summer 2019 I looked/felt pretty smart. But it's now more than doubled and I'd be shit out of luck if I was still holding on.And it's not just me. I remember this [Josh Brown blog post](https://thereformedbroker.com/2019/04/26/why-tesla-is-a-better-short-at-lower-prices/) which in hindsight got it completely wrong as well (even though I was nodding along with everything at the time), and he's far more knowledgeable than I am.So if you were "smart" you could have nearly trebled your money in the last 6 months just by investing in Tesla. When you compare that to the S&P 500 (+29% in 2019, and a longer run historical rate of ~10% a year), it sure seems like a much faster way of getting rich, and you think "how hard can it be?".I think the allure of trying to beat the market comes from it being so simple. Every stock, every day can either go up or down, and that's it. In theory, it means half the time you'll be correct. But as Yogi Berra said:

*In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.*

So just knowing stocks go up or down doesn't mean you can call it correctly in advance. And that certainly doesn't mean you can repeatedly call it in advance. You probably can trick yourself that you would get it right the whole time - “I knew the iPhone was going to be big as soon as it came out!”. But even Apple had a 30%+ drawdown at the end of 2018. Would you have held on then, or would you have sold after it had gone down? And what about all those other opinions you claimed in the bar but have since forgotten - have they all done as well as Apple? Or even matched the stock market?As frustrating as it seems, getting rich slowly is way more likely to succeed than getting rich quickly. And with the stock market this is often a lesson we have to learn the hard way. So join the self proclaimed maniacs on r/wallstreetbets, lose lots of money, then come crawling back to your index fund, and "just" get the return of the overall market, which the vast majority of investors fail to beat anyway. It might be an expensive lesson, but hopefully that will reduce the allure of trying to beat the market in the future, so if it needs to be done, the sooner the better.
