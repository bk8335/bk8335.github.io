Do I trust myself more than a pile of bricks? This is basically the  dilemma I had been thinking about the last few months. I have a large  amount of money saved up for a flat deposit (over a year's salary).  Originally I wanted to buy my first home, which conveniently enough is  what everyone else around me was doing, what my parents had done, and what was 'expected' of me. I even put in a bid on a nice flat in  Edinburgh. Yet despite this large pot of cash and a pretty good salary  as a software developer, I still didn't have enough to win the flat. So I could try and borrow even more money, maybe extend the terms of the potential mortgage from 25 years up to 30 or 35 years, just to guarantee I'm in more debt?

This was becoming more and more insane to me. Brits are so desperate to "get on the ladder" at any cost. Buying  property worked for the previous generation, and 20+ years of TV shows  has kept this dream in the head of many Brits, despite it getting harder  every single year. But just because your parents house doubled in value, doesn't mean yours will.

Having this large pile of cash  not doing anything was frustrating to say the least. Stuck between  keeping it accessible in case I could magically afford a house, and  wanting to invest it in the stock market, but then not having a long enough time horizon to justify the risk. So I lost out on the returns of the market, but still didn't have enough for a house, and with prices rising  it put me even further behind. 

So I've decided not to do what  was expected of me, but instead forge ahead on my own path. Putting your life savings in a house is effectively admitting that a pile of bricks  will outperform the lifetime of learnings you have accumulated, and that you can't match the value of a few walls. Instead of guaranteeing decades of debt for a single illiquid asset, I'm betting on my brain  instead. I'm using the flat deposit to go full time on my side-project, [holfolio.com](https://www.holfolio.com) for the rest of 2020, having given in my notice this week.

Too many people are too intimidated to invest in the stock market. Showing  them what you do and the returns you've gotten will help encourage them to get more from their money, and potentially let them retire years earlier. The [‘JAMs’](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/Global/CitizensAdvice/Work%20Publications/JustAboutManaging-final.pdf) keeping their savings in the bank earning 0.1% interest is leaving them further behind. If an honest financial advisor sat them down for an hour, they could improve their financial situation ([and hence just about every other situation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/money-marriage-end-divorce-day-relationships-personal-finances-slater-gordon-a8147921.html)) massively. To me this is such an important issue to work on it is worth giving up my salary for.

So I hope I've persuaded some of you to question your  decisions a bit more. Are you buying a house because you want to, or  because you are expected to? Could you do more with your savings by putting it in the stock market? And do you think your brain is worth more than some bricks?
