(Apologies in advance for sounding like such a cliched snowflake milennial. Having since gone to the gym I already feel better, but in some ways that is only helping to mask the feelings below...)

The recent Christmas/New Year's break feels like the longest I've had off work in a long time, and the dread of going back to work (having already switched careers once) has made this bubble up again...

I feel like I am procrastinating on life. I am not successful enough to be content/happy i.e. to enjoy the moment and truly relax. A part of me feels like I have not earned it or do not deserve it. I usually feel like I should be doing something more. And yet at the same time I'm not desperate enough to have true hunger. So instead I find myself just stuck in the middle doing 'ok' but not really going anywhere.

Am I having a midlife crisis at 30?! ([If so, apparently I'm a year early](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/the-millennials-at-31-welcome-to-the-age-of-misery))

A lot of this frustration comes from being a wantrepreneur for years and yet not really doing anything about it. I'll dabble with a sideproject every now and then for a little bit, but inevitably give up when no one uses it. And I have never found a way of getting that little bit of traction at the start that can ignite more motivation...

Part of me feels like a drastic change would be good to get me out of my slumber...except I still have bills to pay and would like to be able to afford food etc. And that is where the frustration comes from - its a chicken and egg situation of time and money between work and creating something. I don't have much time/energy to create a great project while working full time, and I don't have the money/risk appetite to quit work and go for it without any traction (plus the fear it will all end in failure anyway - this is why startups in the US are more likely to succeed than in Europe!)  

So rather than just venting, my aim is to reduce the procrastination between enjoying myself and working on something.
I tweeted:
[If you're not having fun you should be doing something productive. If you're not doing something productive you should be having fun.
My procrastination free 2020 goal is to avoid the middle ground](https://twitter.com/HolfolioBen/status/1213452673355321344)

For me, this middle ground to avoid is stupid youtube wormholes and too many pointless reddit threads (the more time you spend on reddit, the more you realise how little of it is new). And to give myself permission to enjoy myself more. Hopefully having more proper downtime (instead of anxiety from not doing anything), will free myself up for more productive pursuits at other times of the day, and achieve more overall.
