There are millions of people in the UK alone who have too much cash earning a paltry rate of interest in their local bank account (losing value in real terms). Instead of working for your money, why not make your money work for you? Put excess cash in the stock market and earn an average return of 7 to 10%+ a year. Many people already know this, and know that they should do something with their cash, but don't. Often they are too scared to make a move into the stock market, feeling overwhelmed when they look at all of the options. 

For most people, as soon as you start talking about globally diversified ETF's, interest rates, inflation, compounding etc. you can physically see their eyes glaze over. We have tried telling people what to do with their money for decades. And let's be honest, it hasn't really worked that well has it?

Show not tell is a mantra in writing. It elicits stronger emotions in the reader.
And this is what we need in finance. Because inertia is a really strong force to fight against. We all know the power of defaults (aka the one sentence summary of [Nudge](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0141040017)), and with investments, the default is to do nothing. So we know we need to get people out of their comfort zone, to get them to actually take action and start investing.

That's why I'm building [Holfolio](https://www.holfolio.com), to allow investors to show people what they do, not just tell them what they should do. 

I often think how finance and fitness have a lot in common. The fitness industry is also overwhelming for people starting out (they know they should exercise more but that's about it). There are a million articles online of the "best" diet, or the "best" workout routine, and half of them will contradict the other half. The result is people glaze over and can't trust anything. But if you see a friend for the first time in a few months and they look happier and healthier than ever before, you will love to hear what they have to say. It could motivate you enough to listen to what worked for them, and even if you don't copy everything they do, you might incorporate one or two tips into your own lifestyle.

It should be the same with investments. But because discussing money remains such a taboo, the internet can give us more of a safe space to do this. I started Holfolio thinking how useful it would be to track all of my investments in one place (equities across different brokers, some private investments, some cryptocurrencies etc.). But the more I've worked on it, the more I realise the real power will be to share your investments with others. A community of likeminded individuals can do as much for each other as any overpaid financial advisor can. And that's because the vast majority of investing is so simple - keep regularly putting money in the market and decades later your future self will be very grateful. And if you see other DIY investors doing this, month after month, hopefully it will inspire you to do the same. So use Holfolio to see what others do with their money, instead of being told what to do with yours.
