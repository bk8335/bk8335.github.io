Finance is one of the only industries in the world where you are generally better off by doing less.

It sounds counterintuitive, but if you know that you don't know much, you are way ahead of those who think they know a lot.

That is because beating the stock market is _outrageously_ hard to do, and so by not even trying, you instead guarantee the same return as the overall market. [Roughly 80% of investors underperform the market](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) (the longer the timeframe, the higher this number gets as _repeatedly_ outperforming the market is even harder). Our emotions make us do the exact opposite of what we should do in the market - emotionally we want to sell when things have gone down (even though it is now 'cheap' and effectively on sale), and buy after something has done well (when it is expensive). Our gut reaction is literally the opposite of 'buy low, sell high' - and the more extreme markets get, the more our emotions take over from our rational brains (ask anyone who bought Bitcoin in December 2017 at nearly $20,000 a coin).

Outside of a Louis Vuitton or a Gucci store ([aka Veblen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good)), when has anyone ever been excited to see the cost of something they want to buy go up? And yet that is what thousands of us do everyday in the stockmarket.

So instead of trying to control this emotional primate destroying your returns, you can instead completely sidestep him, and just buy the entire market, aka an index fund.
You not only ensure you will be ahead of the majority of investors financially, but emotionally you will be _way_ better off. You have nothing to stress about, because you have made very few decisions; just buy the index each month, and relax.
If you spend the same amount of money each month on a diversified index it will all take care of itself. And with this mindset of dollar cost averaging, you will welcome price reductions as it means you can now purchase more shares each month. 

Or to put it the opposite way: you could spend hundreds of hours (and often $$$) reading all the books, guides, courses, and tips in the world on how to 'beat the market(tm)'. Then you can stress about every active trading decision you make, constantly doubting yourself, checking prices an unhealty amount, get distracted at your work, and then be rewarded with an 80% chance of being worse off than the guy who just bought the index each month and sleeps well at night.

So which would you rather be?! _Don't try and beat the market, just be the market._
