There was also a good article in the Guardian this week looking at how wealth disparities can (tear apart friendships.)[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/11/the-wealth-gap-how-changing-fortunes-tear-close-friends-apart]
I first wrote something similar in April 2018 (here)[https://benkinnard.substack.com/p/why-is-personal-finance-so-anti-social-5a13863eca1] and expand upon it more here.

We have social networks for everything nowadays, e.g. running (Strava), dieting (MyFitnessPal), work (LinkedIn), side hustles (IndieHackers), etc. but as soon as it comes to money, suddenly everyone becomes very secretive and private and won’t share how they are doing. It's ok to show off your expensive looking holiday on instagram, but actually discussing the cost is taboo. It's one of the reasons luxury brands succeed, as they are effectively a medium to display that you have money without being so vulgar as to talk about it directly.
So despite us being more and more open about everything in our lives, we still tend to clam up when it comes to money. I have never known if my best friends save any money at the end of the month, or blow their whole salary. I don't even know the salary of most of my friends. It's weird that in such a social age, we are still so private about or money.

There are obvious explanations for this of course — our ‘social worth’ can be summed up neatly in our financial net worth. Its why billionaire hedge fund managers still go to the office every day at 6am, their wealth is the scorecard against other billionaires and they want to win. And that would explain why we don't want to talk about it more publicly - by definition half of us are below average and thus would feel bad. So just having a vague idea of each others wealth keeps people happy in their ignorance.

But not talking about money is ironically enough costing us money. Because of this, when we look to invest we are all alone in the dark, scary world of the financial markets. And the only people who can show us the way are insiders who will of course charge us a hefty fee for this advice (aka "buy an index fund"). So some of us stump up the poll tax and way for financial advice in one form or another. But an ever larger share of the population are too afraid to go it alone, and also not wealthy enough to afford this advice. So even worse, they do nothing. They leave their money earning a pittance in the bank, losing money in real terms to inflation. With just a small nudge, knowing other people who have braved investing and lived to tell the story might encourage them to do it as well. If we talked about investing more, we could help guide each other through the markets - share which pitfalls to avoid, what worked for us etc. And in a more empathetic way than a robot could ever do. 

That might all sound too idealistic and naive. Because of the self-worth being tied to financial worth, people might be slow to do this. But as they say, (on the internet, no one knows you're a dog)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog]. Online you could use the pseudonymity to hide your true identity, freeing yourself up to be more open about finance and investments.  

In an age where we share everything, being more public about our finances might encourage us to realise greater financial freedom. And that is the basic idea behind (Holfolio)[https://www.holfolio.com] - be more open to help you and others chart the financial markets without having to pay through the nose for advice.
